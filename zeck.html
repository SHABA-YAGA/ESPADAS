    <h1>ABOUT ARTIST</h1>
    <h4>Chronologivcally 17 yrs old but mentally 40</h4>
    <h4>A distinct combination of genes and experiences, just as you are. One among 7 billion others. All born in different circumstances, all with different dreams.And that's the best part--if you were just like me, there would be nothing more that I could learn from you. But we all have our stories; there are so many things that you have experienced that I might have never dreamed of, and there is so much that I have seen and done and loved that you have yet to. A friend is a chance to open your mind, and a stranger is a friend you have yet to make.</h4>
